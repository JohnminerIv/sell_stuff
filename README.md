Hey this is a deployed web app.
Please go to [this Heroku-site](https://buy-n-sell-jm.herokuapp.com)
Then follow the link to create a new user.
You can now see items listed by other people.
If you click more information it will bring you to a page so you can add that item to your cart.
You can alway go back to the home page by clicking the Buy-N-Sell words in the top left.
Please explore the site at your own pace.
If you want to list your own items for other users to buy you can go to edit account and type in seller where it prompts for a password to sell items.
If you log in as me you can even view other users with accounts and delete them.
